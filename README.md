### Requirements
You will need [node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) installed.

Run `npm i -g typescript` (in terminal) to install typescript on your machine.

### Project Setup

1. Run `npm i` (in terminal while inside the project) to install the required packages.
1. If using a version of MongoDB different from 3.6, update the file `mongo.cmd` at line
```C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe``` 
to the version of MongoDB installed. (**3.6** to your version)
1. Create a path `uploads/db` from the root of the project. Local MongoDB data will be saved here.
1. Run `mongo.cmd` command first. (double-click cmd file from the file explorer or run `./mongo.cmd` from terminal)
1. Run `complie.cmd` on any changes made.
1. Run `start.cmd` to start running locally at <http://localhost:3000>

### Getting Started
This project was completed in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). For more information on developing in Typescript [here](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

`wptest-vm.tsx` contains the model of the data that the view is in sync with and displays.

`wptest.tsx` contains the elements and the logic of the view. View elements are written using the [React and JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) syntax, but under the hood use [mithril](https://mithril.js.org/jsx.html) as base for a [custom framework](wwwroot/src/lib/wptest-framework.tsx). Essentially each `Tag` represent a DOM element, and can define (bound) attributes which you can use to pass data into it. Additionally, you can define helper functions within the scope of the element, and use local state where appropriate.

This project uses the [Monaco (Visual Studio Code Online Editor)](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) as its editor. You can find its definition in [monaco.d.ts](wwwroot/src/lib/monaco.d.ts)

Run `compile.cmd` on any changes made to compile the Typescript into Javascript to use.
